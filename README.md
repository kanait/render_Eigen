# render_Eigen

render_Eigen is a light-weight, header-only library for utilizing OpenGL.

This library heavily depends on [Eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/). It is necessary to download the Eigen library and use it together with render_Eigen.

A sample file [vbo_glfw_eigen.cxx](https://github.com/kanait/render_Eigen/blob/master/samples/vbo_glfw_eigen.cxx) is also provided in the "samples" directory. Please refer to it to understand how to use the library.

[render](https://github.com/kanait/render.git) is recommended if you use [vecmath-cpp library](https://github.com/yuki12/vecmath-cpp).
